# My-Progress-on-Touch-Typing

Introduction:

I practiced touch typing during the month of July 2022. Before this, I would use the Hunt and Peck method (two-fingered typing) as it is the most common typing technique. My limit speed with this method was 40 wpm yet, using this method resulted in a lot of mistakes. My goal for this project was to impove my typing speed without looking at the keyboard while making less mistakes. I spent the first week learning the layout of the QWERTY keyboard. In the second week, I started tracking my progress using Monkeytype.com everyday over the span of two weeks. My desired typing speed was 50 words per minute as this is the minimum requirement for typing skills at most jobs.
